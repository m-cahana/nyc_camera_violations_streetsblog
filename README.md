# NYC camera violations (for Streetsblog)

A look into school zone violations in New York City, and the tail-end of drivers who contribute a significant share of violations despite being relatively small in number. 

This project uses Python for data processing, and D3 and Mapbox for visualization.

Some raw datasets used in this project are too large to store on GitHub. But you can find the raw dataset required for processing and visualization here:

* [Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal Year 2024](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2024/pvqr-7yc4/about_data)


You can then run [violations_agg.py](https://github.com/m-cahana/nyc_camera_violations_streetsblog/blob/main/data/python/violations_agg.py) and [violations_analysis.py](https://github.com/m-cahana/nyc_camera_violations_streetsblog/blob/main/data/python/violations_analysis.py) to process it.

Alternatively, you can just work with the processed datasets [here](https://github.com/m-cahana/nyc_camera_violations_streetsblog/tree/main/data/processed)
